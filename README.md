# prime-proton (WIP)

POC of a UI Design Visual Editor, using ElectronJS, React, PrimeNg, PrimeReact PrimeIcons, PrimeFlex, InversifyJS etc.

Where the Angular, PrimeNg e Inversify are only for the result project by the user.
For development, is Next, React, PrimeReact and others.

The solution most run with ElectronJS or one recent browser (2020 foward).

Likely a wysiwyg the user compose the UI with drag-drop components, edit properties and can export the result as a Angular 10 webapp with PrimeNg, PrimeIcons and PrimeFlex.
