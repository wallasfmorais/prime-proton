# prime-proton (WIP)
POC of a UI Design Visual Editor, using ElectronJS, React, PrimeNg. PrimeIcons, PrimeFlex, InversifyJS etc. 

Likely a wysiwyg the user compose the UI with drag-drop components, edit properties and can export the result as a Angular 10 webapp with PrimeNg, PrimeIcons and PrimeFlex.

###### At this stage, anything can change on the development flow. Feel free to open a [issue](https://github.com/wallasfmorais/prime-proton/issues/new) with suggestions.

###### I'll commit / push directly to the master just while I'm alone in this rodeo.
